    <h2>Brief Info</h2>
    <p>This sites is all about CRUD operation like creating users, reading saved user data, finding user data, updating the user's data (if and when necessary) and at last deleting the user's data if the admin or certain users required. 
    This is like my previously done CRUD app using Python and MYSQL. But in the case of nodejs😪, it takes more brainpower and better knowledge of javascript. 
    But with Hardwork, dedication, a few sleepless nights(my case was different tho😂😁) and coffee i think you would be alright🤞🏼👍🏼. Enjoy!!!
